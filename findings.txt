	Findings: Edge Peeled by weight for graph. Produced 8 pictures, one for each weight. If I were a rail road crossing owner, I would prefer the graphs to be focused on the subgraph with all edges weight 1. This would imply that the incidents for this crossing were different. I would not want a concentration on the subgraph with all weights maxiumum. This would imply that all the incidents were identical. The density is determined by number of incident attributes (circles). This suggests to associate with each crossing, a vector of dimension equal to the number of incidents, where entry i of this vector represents the co-occurence of the number of attributes that appear in exactly i accidents. This will allow us to compare rail crossings by suitable vector operations.
